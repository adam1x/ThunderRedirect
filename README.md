#ThunderRedirect
Download links from "Thunder Lixian" goes through an HTTP redirection until getting to the actual URL. Thunder geoblocks its services from the US by redirecting to a bogus domain. This script captures the actual URLs by accessing download links through a proxy and then forwards them to a running aria2 instance.

##Usage
User needs to input the hostname [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) is running on (with [JSON-RPC](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#rpc-options) enabled), an RPC authorization secret token, a proxy server, and raw aria2 commands generated by [ThunderLixianExporter](https://github.com/binux/ThunderLixianExporter).

After a proxy server is supplied for the first time, it will be saved in `proxy.txt`.
